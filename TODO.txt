TO DO:
Be able to save Username and passwords in their own little files
    use saveinfo to write info to .acc
        detect if account already exists
            user.cpp line 201
    use loadinfo to read and load info to program
    -possibly encrypt the info? look into encryption libraries...
    
Change cancelValue so that even I dont know what it is on boot

Add GUI?
