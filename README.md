# Introduction
Hello! I don't know how you have stumbled across this dumb git repo.
However, whatever, I don't care.
# What is it??
This lil program does a lot of **cool** stuff, including (*but no limited to*):
* Introduce you to its stupidity
* Prompt you to make a username and password
* Validate those to see if their **worthy**
* Save those credentials to a file inside a nifty little folder called `Users`
# What do I still need to work on?
- [ ] Work on logging into the social media after initial signup.
- [ ] Encypt their files so they dont get haxxors
- [ ] Add GUI using Qt or GTK?
